I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you gon' get your act together?
I ain't your mama

No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no
Wake up and rise and shine (ah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Best get to work on time (ah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
No more playing video games (ah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Things are about to change ('round here, 'round here)
We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how it was?
When did you get too comfortable?

'Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey
I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
